# System Architecture

## Overview

The Real-Time Messaging System is designed to provide real-time communication between users and services through a message broker, user session management, message storage, and APIs. The system is scalable, secure, and optimized for low-latency communication.

## Core Components

1. **Message Broker**
   - Responsible for routing messages between publishers and subscribers.
   - Implements both Pub/Sub and message queue patterns.
   - Supports different transport protocols like WebSocket and RabbitMQ.

2. **User Sessions and Presence**
   - Manages user session states (active, inactive) and tracks user presence in real-time.
   - Provides session replication across nodes for fault tolerance.

3. **Message Storage**
   - Messages are stored in both relational databases (MySQL/PostgreSQL) and NoSQL databases (MongoDB, Cassandra).
   - Supports file storage for large media attachments (AWS S3, Local storage).

4. **Real-Time Notifications**
   - In-app, push, and web notifications ensure real-time message delivery.
   - Integrations include Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) and Apple Push Notification Service (APNS).

5. **APIs and WebSocket Gateway**
   - RESTful APIs for messaging operations and a WebSocket Gateway for real-time communication.

6. **Scalability and Load Balancing**
   - Supports auto-scaling, load balancing (Nginx, HAProxy), and distributed caching (Redis, Memcached).

7. **Security**
   - Implements secure communication with TLS, message encryption, and API key-based authentication.
   - Includes DDoS protection and Web Application Firewall (WAF) for additional security layers.

## Data Flow

Messages flow through the system starting from publishers, routed by the message broker to subscribers, stored if necessary, and delivered via notifications.

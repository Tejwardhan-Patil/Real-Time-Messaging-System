# Security Best Practices

## Secure Communication

1. **TLS Encryption**
   - Ensure that all communication between clients and the server uses TLS (Transport Layer Security).

2. **Message Encryption**
   - Encrypt messages at rest and in transit to protect sensitive data.

## Authentication and Authorization

1. **JWT Authentication**
   - Use JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for authenticating API requests.
   - Implement token expiration and renewal.

2. **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**
   - Enforce RBAC to ensure users have the correct permissions for actions they perform.

3. **API Key Management**
   - Secure API endpoints with API keys and ensure that keys are rotated regularly.

## Protection Against Attacks

1. **DDoS Protection**
   - Implement DDoS protection using rate-limiting and firewall rules.

2. **Web Application Firewall (WAF)**
   - Use a Web Application Firewall to block malicious traffic.

3. **Audit Logging**
   - Maintain audit logs for critical system operations to detect and respond to security breaches.

4. **Penetration Testing**
   - Regularly perform penetration tests to identify and address vulnerabilities.

## Monitoring and Incident Response

- Set up monitoring tools like Prometheus and Grafana to detect unusual traffic or behavior.
- Configure alerts for incidents related to security breaches.
